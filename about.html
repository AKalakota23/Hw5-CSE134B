            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Hey, I'm Akhil. I'm a computer engineering student with a passion for <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">signals and systems</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">digital hardware design</abbr>, and all things related to computer architecture and ciruits. 
                I thrive on tackling hands-on projects, from building smart glasses powered by an ESP32 to developing AI-powered squirrel detection systems. 
                Along the way, I’ve explored PCB design, app development, and much more, constantly pushing the boundaries of what I can create.
            </p>
            <p>Outside of engineering, I'm often lost in the world of stories, whether through books, games, or art. I'm an avid reader, particularly drawn to horror and dark fantasy.
                Brandon Sanderson’s works hold a special place in my heart, with <i>Yumi and the Nightmare Painter</i> being my personal favorite. 
                Recently, I've diving into science fiction like the <i>Three Body Problem</i> and feminist literature such as <i>The Handmaiden's Tale</i>. 
                If you’re curious about my thoughts on these, feel free to check out my reviews on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/187158731?ref=nav_mybooks">Goodreads</a>.</p>
                <p>Lately, I've also developed a growing interest in art history, inspired by my love for creating art in my free time. It's fascinating to explore how art has evolved over the centuries an how it continues to shape modern design. 
                    My favorite art style would have to be <dfn>Art Nouveau</dfn>, which is an art style that in inspired by natural forms and curves. It was mainly active during 1883 - 1914.</p>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my little corner of the web! Here, you’ll find my projects, notes, and thoughts on everything from transistors to the latest sci-fi rabbit hole I’ve fallen into. 
                        Check out the projects page to see what I’ve been building, or reach out if you want to chat about tech, books, or even squirrels.
