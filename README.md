# portflio-website Part 3 changes
I added a set of custom SVG icons next to the "Welcome to My Personal Domain" header. These icons provide quick access to my GitHub profile, email, and resume download, making it easier for visitors to connect with me. This was made to replace the quick links on my home page. I also feel that these changes make the website much more visually pleasing than before. I also got rid of the search bar because it is no longer a relevant requirement.
